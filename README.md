# GamerLabs

This is social media like app designed for the user to connect with friends and discuss opinions/react to thier favorite games. 
This app uses the Steam API to grab information for player data such as the kind of games played, time spent and other user data to showcase to other users.
With this app users can showcase their personality through the various games played and their reactions to other users post. 
At the same time through the friends list users will be able to find other players and build a community to keep discussions going and discover new information for as long as the account is active.
This application is deployed using Heroku. Please use the link below to access the deployed site.
